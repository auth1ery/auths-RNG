2. customizable settings
3. data control (basically being able to do stuff with your data like resetting it)
4. fun little slot animation
5. inventory with stacking
6. achievements
7. thats it

# what the hell do i do with this code????
you can change my messy code and maybe optimize it (so updating code in neocities isnt the most laggy thing ever)
